    <h3>Neroli Cosmetiqué</h3>
    <p class="project-blurb">
      Neroli is a beauty brand, focused on clean and fresh skincare. Their range of products includes bath gels and body lotions, as well as facial scrubs, moisturizers, and other products aimed at creating a “at-home spa” experience.
      <br><br>
      The color story features toned down oranges and light, airy grays and white — making the brand look fresh and natural, without looking too “clinical.” Neroli is a vegan, cruelty-free brand as well, so their brand image was designed to reflect their values of “natural is beautiful.”
      <br><br>
      This project includes <em>brand development</em>, <em>print design</em>, and <em>web design</em>.
